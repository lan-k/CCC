        "In this exercise, we are going to fit a logistic regression to our data set, by using two techniques that constrains (or regularizes) the coefficient estimates with a L1-norm (Lasso regularization) and a L2-norm regularization (Ridge regularization). \n",
        "\n",
        "1. The Lasso regularization will shrink the coefficient estimates towards zero or <b>directly to zero</b>. For this last reason, Lasso regularization is a technique for feature selection (those features that are not zero in the model). \n",

        "2. The Ridge regularization will shrink the coefficient estimates **towards zero**.\n",
        "\n",
        "The advantage of regularization versus plain least squares has to do with the bias-variance trade off.
